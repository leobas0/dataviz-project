# dataviz-project

The project was part of the course of Data Visualisation taught at CentraleSupelec and its main objective was to create visualisations from a dataset.

## Introduction and project motivation
Music has been an integral part of human culture and experience for thousands of years. It has the power to evoke strong emotions and shape our moods, making it an interesting area of study for psychologists and researchers. However, despite its widespread impact, little is still understood about the relationship between music and psychology. Previous research has suggested that music can influence our emotions and moods in different ways, depending on factors such as genre, bpm, or personal taste. For instance, fast-paced music can increase arousal and excitement, while slower music can evoke feelings of sadness or calmness. However,  more scientific research is needed to better understand the complex relationship between music and emotions.

## Dataset
The MxMH dataset aims to identify what, if any, correlations exist between an individual's music taste and their self-reported mental health. Ideally, these findings could contribute to a more informed application of MT or simply provide interesting sights about the mind.
Data collection was managed by @catherinerasgaitis via a Google Form. Respondents were not restricted by age or location. The form was posted in various Reddit forums, Discord servers, and social media platforms. Posters and "business cards" were also used to advertise the form in libraries, parks, and other public locations. The form was relatively brief so that respondents would be more likely to finish the survey. "Harder" questions (such as BPM) were left optional for the same reason.
